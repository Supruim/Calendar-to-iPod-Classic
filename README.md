# Sync MacOs Calendar with an iPod classic.

## Why i wanted this

I use my Calendar daily and i love listening to music on my iPod. But when i got it i quickly found out you can't sync the calendar anymore so i searched for a solution but couldn't find any, so when i figured out how to achieve it, i oughte share it here with you!

## Steps

1. Open u Calendar and go to Archive > Export > Export and save the .ics file.
2. Connect your iPod (Classic), open Finder and go to the Calendar folder
move the .ics file to that folder. 
3. Reject your iPod.
4. Disconnect your iPod and go to Extra > Calendar and now you can see your Calendar entries on your iPod.


## Future Plans

In the future i am planning on making a sync feature so that every time you connect your iPod again, it will sync up with your newest Calendar entries.
Maybe syncthing to compare the two folders?
