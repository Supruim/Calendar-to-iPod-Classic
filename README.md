# Sync MacOs Calendar with an iPod classic

open u Calendar and go to Archive > Export > Export and save the .ics file
connect your iPod (Classic) and open Finder and go to the Calendar folder
move the .ics file to that folder. reject your iPod 
Disconnect your iPod and go to Extra > Calendar and now you can see your Calendar entries on your iPod.


## Future Plans

In the future i am planning on making a sync feature so that every time you connect your iPod again, it will sync up with your newest Calendar entries.
